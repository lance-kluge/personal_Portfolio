      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        <strong>Mini Git</strong> was the final project for my CSCI 2275 Data Structures course in Fall 2023.
        My teammate and I built a lightweight version control system in C++ that tracked file versions,
        allowed reverting to previous commits, and included a robust testing suite.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Technical Details</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        We used a linked list to manage commits (each node being a commit) and a second linked list
        to track files within each commit, with hashes used for commit naming. Our testing suite included
        function tests and a comprehensive stress test that simulated all possible user actions, ensuring
        a stable and reliable final product.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      Building <strong>Mini Git</strong> was an incredibly fun experience that enabled me to really start to understand working collaboratively .
      Ephram and I worked really well together and were able to develop a great product with a test suite that I am very proud of.
      We did so well that we even got a comment from our professor saying "Best submission I have seen. Code is clean and concise, well organized. Everything works exactly as expected. Great job!"
